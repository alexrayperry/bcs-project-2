# Project Title: #BlackLivesMatter Sentiment Visualization

Team Members:  Alex, Nithya, Francisco, Tran

Github Repository: https://github.com/alexrayperry/bcs-project-2

Project Description/Outline: In this project, we will collect popular hashtags relating to current political climate (I.e. #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM,etc) data from twitter and map that on the top populated 100 cities using leaflet. The HTML/CSS page will let users filter specific cities to visualize hashtag data.  Final visualization dashboard will include a leaflet map with data plotted, and a bar graph of top ten cities with the most hashtags. 

Research Questions to Answer: 
Which cities are tweeting the most about the protests with hashtag #BLM.
How does the tweet count represent the cityâ€™s sentiments?
